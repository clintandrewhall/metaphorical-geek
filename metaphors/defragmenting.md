title: Defragmenting
...

<M4Definition source="Wikipedia">
  In the maintenance of file systems, defragmentation is a process that reduces
  the amount of fragmentation. It does this by physically organizing the
  contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest
  number of contiguous regions (fragments).

  <M4Title>Defragmenting is Moving Hangers in your Closet.</M4Title>
  As people wear clothing in their closet, they tend to take an article from the
  rod and leave the hanger in place.  As time passes, as you search for the next
  item you want to wear, the hangers start getting in the way.

  Then, when your laundry is ready to hang up, what do most people do?  Rather
  than search through the hung clothing for a single hanger on which to hang one
  of several items... you find all of the empty hangers and move them to one end.
  This makes it easier to find space for your clothes.

  Defragmenting a hard drive is the same idea.  As files are stored, they're
  placed in empty space as it becomes available.  When you delete a file, the
  space you've allocated for that file is freed (an empty hanger).  Finding empty
  space for your files begins to take longer and longer as time goes on.

  When you defragment the hard drive, you move all of the empty space to one part
  of the disk, making it easier for the computer to find space for new files
  (and making it easier for the disk to find it later!).
