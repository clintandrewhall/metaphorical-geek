<M4Title>An Exploit is the Thermal Exhaust Port on the Death Star</M4Title>
In Star Wars, the Rebel Alliance took advantage of their technical readout of the
Death Star in order to find it's one weakness: a small, two-meter-wide port that
could cause the whole station to explode.  Only when the attach commenced did the
Empire find the vulnerability, and even then they didn't consider it a threat to
their massive space station.

The same is true of servers and other systems.  Brilliant inddividuals with intensely
intimate knowledge can launch a successful attacks on susceptible systems, even
when the administrators of those systems consider them safe.  This often results
in the leaking of information, (credit cards, passwords, etc) or even complete
annihilation of the system itself.
