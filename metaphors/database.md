<M4Definition source="Wikipedia">
A *database* is an organized collection of data. The data are typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information. For example, modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.

  <M4Title>A Database is an Address Book</M4Title>
  Address books store names commonly by last name or first name in alphabetical order.  By storing them in a specific order, finding a name is much quicker than in a phone book that is unordered.  A database is similar in that it stores information in an orderly fashion.
