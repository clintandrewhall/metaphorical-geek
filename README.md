## How to submit your metaphor

Create a pull request with either your addition to an existing metaphor or your
new metaphor in /metaphor in the following format:

```
---
title: Name of the Tech
...

<M4Definition source="{source name}" href="{link}">
{definition as quoted from the source, markdown accepted}
</M4Definition>
<Metaphor id="{some unique id}">
<M4Title>{title of your masterwork}</M4Title>

{content of your masterwork, markdown accepted}

<M4Author handle="{your handle}" href="{link to you}" />
</Metaphor>
```

Markdown is accepted almost anywhere, even outside the tags themselves.  Avoid leading spaces and indentation-- they are honored as markdown. :-D

Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.  Let me know what you think.  Cheers!
