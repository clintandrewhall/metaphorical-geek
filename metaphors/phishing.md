  <M4Title>Phishing is fishing in a lake.</M4Title>
  When you're fishing in a lake, you're trying to catch a fish. When you're phishing on the internet, you're trying to "catch" a victim's personal information. To catch a fish, you must use a bait to lure the fish to your hook. To bait a victim, you send a fake email impersonating one of many legitimate websites the victim might be familiar with. The fish believes that the bait is a normal meal. The victim believes the email is a legitimate request to provide their username and password, or even other sensitive information. The result of both can be disastrous.
