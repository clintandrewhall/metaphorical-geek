...

<M4Definition source="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">
  An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to
  each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network
  that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

<M4Title>An IP Address is a Mailing Address.</M4Title>
Like a mailman delivering mail, an IP Address is how the Internet network knows
how to deliver responses from web servers and other devices directly to you.

While it looks complicated, an IP Address is nothing more than a unique number
to identify you on the Internet.  These numbers are assigned by your ISP, or,
if you have one, your router.

When you request a page from a web server, your request is marked as coming
from a specific address. When the response is ready, the web server sends it to
your specific number, much like you talking to someone over the phone.
