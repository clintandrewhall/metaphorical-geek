<M4Definition source="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">
A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
network, such as the Internet. It enables a computer or Wi-Fi-enabled device to
send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were directly
connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality,
security and management policies of the private network.

<Metaphor id="caller-id">
<M4Title>A VPN is like using 3-way calling and Caller ID</M4Title>
When you call someone, you appear as you on their Caller ID. Unfortunately,
sometimes when you're calling collect or from some other country, you appear as
'Unavailable' or 'Unknown', and the person you're calling doesn't know it's you.
If your friend is suspicious of any unknown number, you might never reach them.

But if you were to call someone else first, and they 3-way dialed to the
suspicious friend you intended to call, the name on the Caller ID would be the
friendly person... but would also have you on the line.

This is what a VPN is like... when you connect using a VPN to your company's
network, (or a private VPN, for that matter), you assume a 'friendly' IP
address; you're 'virtually' connected to the network in the country.  Servers
and users don't know you're somewhere else, because all of your traffic (your
'call') is being routed through your 'friendly' network.  This gives you
access to 'suspicious' (private) 'friends' (services) on that network.
