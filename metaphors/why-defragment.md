title: Why do we need to defragment?

Imaging the storage device is a suitcase. Every time, we add something new. It is that we put something into the suitcase. We  also delete something usually. Which is the opposite, we are pulling something out of the suitcase. 

Here is a problem. What if we want to add one more big object into the suitcase? We all know that this suitcase has enough space to hold it. Since, we have already pulled enough stuff out. However, the space is randomly left in the suitcase. What should we do? Reorganizing the suitcase! Bingo! This is the time and the reason we need to defragment our storage device as well!
