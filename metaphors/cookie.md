A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is a
small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser while
the user is browsing that website.

<M4Title>A Cookie is a Handstamp at a Bar</M4Title>
When you go to a bar, and you pay the bouncer cover, you might get a hand stamp
to prove you paid.  If you go out to a few others, you might collect several
stamps.  By the end of the night, someone might ask, "hey, have you been to
those bars?"  That might surprise you, that it was obvious where you had been
to a total stranger, so you wash them off.

But then, when you go back to the first bar, the bouncer won't remember who you
are.

That's what an HTTP Cookie is... a small "stamp" in your browser that shows
where you were and perhaps something specific you looked at.  And that first
bouncer could be your banking, email, travel or other website that doesn't
"remember" you once you delete all of your cookies.
