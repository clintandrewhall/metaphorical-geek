  <M4Title>An API is a Contract</M4Title>
  In everyday life, a contract defines responsibilities between parties.  For example, someone giving money and then receiving services from another person.  An API is a contract, as well.  It strictly defines what a programmer supplies and then what they receive from a server, library or other programming construct.
