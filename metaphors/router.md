A router is a networking device, commonly specialized hardware, that forwards
data packets between computer networks.

<Metaphor id="operator" image="headset">
<M4Title>A router is a Telephone Operator.</M4Title>
In the "old days", you didn't dial someone directly, you lifted the handset and
asked the operator to connect you somewhere.  Telephone operators sat at large
switchboards and would quite literally connect you to someone else by plugging
your cord into the correct outlet.

A router does the same thing.  When websites want to be able to send a webpage
to your computer, the router connects the web server's message to your device
(rather than some other device in your house).

<Metaphor id="receptionist">
<M4Title>A router is a Receptionist.</M4Title>
When you connect a router to your modem, it takes the IP address of your modem
and gives everyone connected to it a private IP address that only it knows.
When you ask a web server for a web page, the router connects you, but the web
server only knows the "public" ip address.  When the web server responds with
your web page, only the router knows where to send that information.

If you were having a meeting with someone at an office, only the receptionist
knows where everyone sits and their phone numbers.  He or she would then send
your message to the person, rather than connect you directly.
